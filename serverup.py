# This is a small little program that checks if a server is up or down. I know I could have used simple requests to check if its operational, but I wanted to learn how to use subprocess.
# I also wanted to learn how to use Discord webhooks, so I added that in as well. I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it works for me. 
# Use at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any damages caused by this program. Not that there should be any! It might not even work! :D
